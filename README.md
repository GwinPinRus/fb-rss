Facebook public pages as RSS feed!

Simple ruby rack app serving Facebook pages as RSS. 

Local setup: Create you own facebook app, set FB_ACCESS_TOKEN env variable to your secret token and run `rackup`, navigate to `http://localhost:9292` and follow instructions on website.

Using app hosted by me: go to https://facebook-rss-feed.herokuapp.com/ 

Have fun!
